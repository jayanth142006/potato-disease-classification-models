# ðŸ¥” Potato Disease Classification using Deep Learning
This project focuses on classifying potato leaf diseases using advanced deep learning models. It employs a two-stage approach:

Stage 1: Transfer learning with CNN architectures including VGG19, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, and Xception using TensorFlow, achieving accuracy between 70â€“80%, and further fine-tuned to reach 91â€“94%.

Stage 2: Transformer-based models such as ViT, Swin, CoAt, and DeiT implemented in PyTorch, pushing the accuracy to 94â€“97%.

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of both CNNs and Vision Transformers for agricultural disease detection.
